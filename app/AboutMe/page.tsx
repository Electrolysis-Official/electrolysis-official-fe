      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p className="aboutme-paragraph1">I’m a trans girl who’s gone through the hair removal process myself. In total, it took me 3 years and around $15k to remove my facial and body hair. Additionally I had an abundance of blonde and red hairs meaning that laser hair removal wouldn’t work on those hairs. I thought electrolysis was only going to be a couple of hours and I was in for a treat to realize it would be an additional 60 hours of electrolysis to fully be rid of my hair. I was fortunate to have technicians that were highly skilled in the field and did the job right. I haven’t shaved in 2 years now; a testimonial that goes beyond any words on a website. .<br />

      I live in Denver and am proud to serve the community, because everyone deserves to feel comfortable in their bodies!</p>
