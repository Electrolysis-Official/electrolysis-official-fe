      <h1>Electrolysis</h1>
      <p className="electrolysis-paragraph1">Electrolysis is the only FDA certified permanent hair removal method. Although other methods like laser hair removal can be highly effective, it is not permanent and usually only causes reductions in hair density and size. Electrolysis, on the other hand, has been around since 1875. It is tried and true….and no other method has proved to be as effective since. This is because electrolysis targets the source of hair growth on an individual hair-by-hair basis
      </p>
  <p className="electrolysis-paragraph2">The basic principle of electrolysis is that a small hair sized probe is inserted into each individual hair follicle. After being properly inserted, a current or heat, runs into the hair follicle and treats it until it’s ability to regrow is halted.
  </p>
  <h2>There are 3 primary modalities of electrolysis: </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Galvanic (DC)</li>
    <li>Thermolysis</li>
    <li>Blend</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p className="electrolysis-paragraph3">Galvanic is the oldest method and it uses DC current to produce lye inside of the follicle, which chemically kills the hair cells responsible for its growth. It is rarely used nowadays because it takes a very long time, between 10-20 seconds of treatment per hair. </p>
  
  <p className="electrolysis-paragraph4">Thermolysis uses heat to kill the hair, and requires extreme precision to cauterize the blood vessels that supply blood to the hair, causing growth. By using heat to damage and seal off those vessels, your hair ceases to growth. Thermolysis is fast and treatment time is only a fraction of a second per hair.</p>
  
  <p className="electrolysis-paragraph5">Blend  uses the primary galvanic modality to chemically kill the hair with lye while also using the heat of thermolysis (at low levels) to heat up the lye. By heating it, the chemical process of destroying the hair is sped up. This reduces treatment time to only 5-10 seconds per hair.</p>
  
  <p className="electrolysis-paragraph6">A good electrologist knows which modality to use depending on the client, their hair, and the area that is being treated. electrologists switch between modalities depending on the client’s needs.</p>
  
  <h3>How long will it take? </h3>
  
  <p className="electrolysis-paragraph7">Electrolysis is one hair at a time, so it is a slow but worthwhile process. Additionally, our hair grows in cycles, so there is a constant process of follicles becoming active and growing while others shed and go dormant. So as we treat one layer of hair, we have to see what regrows and then also continue to treat those dormant follicles as they wake up and start growing again. This means months to years of treatment for high density areas. A full beard has up to 30,000 hairs….which can result in hundreds of hours of electrolysis required to permanently remove it all. It’s difficult to predict a reliable treatment time. Every client is unique and different factors like prior treatments, hormones, hair density and most importantly the skill of your electrologist will determine how long it will take. It took me 3 years of regular hair removal sessions (a combination of laser and electrolysis) to fully remove my own hair. Treatment is most effective the more regularly you receive electrolysis so your electrologist can see how you respond to treatment and what the unique qualities of your hairs are.</p>
  
  <h4>Does Electrolysis work on Everyone? </h4>
  
  <p className="electrolysis-paragraph8">Electrolysis works on all hair types and colors. Unlike laser, which works best on light skin and dark hair, electrolysis treats each individual hair with a needle probe that is able to fit into any follicle. </p>
