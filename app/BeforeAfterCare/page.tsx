  <h1>Care Before/After</h1>

  <h2>Before - </h2>
  
  <p className="bacareParagraph1">Stay hydrated! it will make treatment more effective since the current needs to interact with the moisture in the hair follicle to properly treat the hair. </p>
  
  <p className="bacareParagraph2">Wait 2 weeks after your last laser, dermabrasion, chemical peel treatment before starting electrolysis treatment. You should also avoid combining treatments in the same area. If you are doing laser on one area of the body and electrolysis on another, that is okay. </p>
  
  <p className="bacareParagraph3">Come with no makeup on the area to be treated. It will otherwise need to be removed before we start treatment. </p>
  
  <p className="bacareParagraph4">Avoid caffeine, substances (alcohol, weed), and other activities that could increase your sensitivity to pain during the session</p>
  
  <p className="bacareParagraph5">If you want to minimize pain, you may use ibuprofen, benedryl, or topical anesthetics - these products should be used or applied at least 30 minutes before treatment so that it is effective and will have been absorbed before the surface of your skin is sterilized pre-treatment. </p>
